# Bouncehammer Wrapper API

While the fantastic [bounce**Hammer**](http://bouncehammer.jp/) project now contains an HTTP API, it is somewhat limited to two actions. This project intends to very crudely wrap the bounce**Hammer** CLI tools with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) routes and return the JSON results.

This assumes that this Sinatra app is running on the same server as the bounce**Hammer** server itself.

Details of implemented CLI tools and API routes to come soon.
